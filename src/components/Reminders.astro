    <h5>Lamp Posts</h5>
    <p>Keep the light burning! The lamps have automatic sensors, so please keep the lanterns on for safety. The assocation covers the cost of the lamp 
      post bulb changes and/or photocell replacements. If your lamp post light is not working please do not attempt to change the bulb or photocell yourself. 
      You are asked to notify MGMC via email so they can issue a work order to have the bulb changed or photocell replaced.

    <h5>Mailboxes</h5>
    <p>Please inform management immediately if you notice your mailbox door is loose or the spring is broke. Please note that broken springs lead to door hinges, 
      so we are asking all residents to inspect/monitor for broken springs and report any related issues or direct any questions to MGMC via email.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The current maintenance plan is to replace broken springs and repair door hinges if possible. As communicated, our current mailboxes are no longer being 
      manufactured. The Board investigated short-term/long-term options for replacing the existing mailboxes. As a result the short-term plan is to replace a 
      group of mailboxes on one of the courts with new, similarly styled mailboxes and use the old for spare parts. This plan should address spare parts for 3-5 years.
